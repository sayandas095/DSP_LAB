# Bracket matching problem
 In this problem we will be taking a string that contains the brackets.
 A input string is valid if and only if :
 1. Open bracket must be enclosed by the same bracket.
 2. Open Brackets must be closed in correct order

# Linklist of binary number
 We will be creating a singly link list which contains either 0 or 1 as element only
 1. Provide an Insert function for inserting nodes with value either 0 or 1 only.(insert it at beginning or end)
 2. Provide a function to calculate equivalent decimal value by taking singly linklist elements as binary number.

# Color set problem
A source code on C is written to create a singly circular linked list. A node consists of
• Character array to store three strings in “info” part
• Address of next node as “link” part

The following are the operations:

a) Creating five nodes dynamically in a linked list with string values as given bellow (c) in the “info” part

b) Third string value in the current node should match the first string value in the next node

c) Displaying five nodes as follows
1. blue      red      green
2. green     black    yellow
3. yellow    white    orange
4. orange    grey     violet
5. violet    brown    blue

d) Displaying only the second-string values of a linked list

e) Replacing first string values of the first and fifth node with the value “color” string and display all five nodes and also display the output as “String not matching”
