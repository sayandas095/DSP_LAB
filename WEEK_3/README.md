# Multi queue operation
Writing a source code in c to implement efficiently multiple queues in a single array.
1. Multiple queues are 4
2. The Queue, name Q1 containing 5 elements
3. Second Queue, name Q2 containing 3 elements
4. Third Queue, name Q3 containing 2 elements
5. Fourth Queue, name Q4 containing 6 elements
6. Delete operation performing on the maximum number of elements in queue
7. Insert operation performing on the minimum number of elements in the Queue
8. Performing the sequence of operations: Delete, Delete, Delete, Insert, Insert, Delete, Display all four queues.

# Spliting a Circular Linked List into two halves
Given a Circular Linked List of size N, spliting it into two halves circular lists. If there are odd number of nodes in the given circular linked list then out of the resulting two halved lists, first list having one node more than the second list. The resultant lists are also circular lists and not linear lists.

# Priority queue
Writing a source code in c on implementing a priority queue
Considering,
1. Creating Queue using arrays
2. Input for the Queue is the name of the student, Gate score of the student(G1)
3. Performing the operations:
Insert(name,G1),
Insert(name,G2(G2>G1)),
Insert(name,G3(G3<G2)),
Insert(name,G4(G4=G2)),
Delete,
Insert(name,G5(G5<G2)),
Delete,
Display the name of the student along with Gate Score
